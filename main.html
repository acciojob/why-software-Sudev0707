	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
      I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving real-world
      problems using logic, creativity, and technology. Building applications
      that can help people, automate tasks, and bring new ideas to life excites
      me. The continuous learning in this field keeps me motivated, and the
      ability to turn simple concepts into powerful products inspires me to grow
      as a developer.
